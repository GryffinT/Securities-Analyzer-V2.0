Overall strategy
-----------------
Factors:
    I. competitive advantage
        a. ROI scales with Moat none >10y -> Narrow 10y -> Wide 20y
            - 20 year benchmark (MorningStar)
            - Ability to defend against rival companies over the course of the benchmark
        b. Cost advantage
            - Cost Of Goods Sold / Sales #Firm to peers
            - Operating Costs / Sales #Internal efficiency
            - Total Costs/Sales #Internal efficiency
            - Normalized composite score > industry index using same calculations
            - weight the score components based off of importance (Potential for ML)
            - Total Product / Cost per unit
            - CapEx as % of revenue (Weighted higher for tech)
            - Revenue per employee (Higher = automation)
            - Days sales of inventory (DSI)
            - inventory turnover (Higher = leaner Supply chain)
            - labor costs/units
            - overall firm size
            - macro factors (tariffs, interest rates, etc [can be largely ignored, since only US firms are considered, but its valuable for supply chains!])
        c. Intangible Assets
            - Brand equity (brand name/hype)
            - patents
            - proprietary tech
            - related regulation
            - ratings
        d. Network effect
            - integration into established groups/niches
        e. Switching costs
            - Cost for consumers to switch
                - how integral is the service to their operations?
    I. Technical
        a. Internal (compared to history)
            - P/E 
            - price movements (vectors)
            - prevailing trends/patterns
            -
